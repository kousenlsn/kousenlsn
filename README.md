### Why hello there!

I'm **Guilherme**, **Marcelo**, or **Kousen**, and I am a brazilian Fullstack Software engineer, mostly passionate lately for:

:nut_and_bolt: Javascript

:busts_in_silhouette: User Experience (specially their happy face)

:rocket: Learning on the fly ([if you want to see my fair share of experiences](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-marcelo-luersen/))

:seedling: Eating plants (and trying calisthenics)

:fire: Digital illustration, concept art, and epic fantasy!
